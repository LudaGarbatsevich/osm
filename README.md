# OpenStreemMap rendering playground 

This is a data directory with GeoServer CSS styles for OSM rendering.
It's going to start as a clone-ish of osm-bright, it's likely that more variants will follow.

While a public repo, it is not meant for public consumption, it's a work in progress with no firm dates and no target releases.
